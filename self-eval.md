# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

Although I faced some challenges while completing the tasks, I was able to overcome them. I had to do some additional research, which proved to be very helpful in teaching me new coding techniques. This allowed me to be successful in the end.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
My workflow is getting way better then how I started at first. I started to take breaks and leave my desk which overall has helped me. This gives me the opportunity to come back with a fresh mind. 
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
I learned that there are lots of methods to help you code and condense your code which is great for you and your collaborators. One method I want to remember as I begin Mod 1 is the attr_accessor method because it saves so much time.
